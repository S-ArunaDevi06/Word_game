# Word game
  This game is implemented as a team of three.

  This is a harry potter theme based game where player is Harry Potter. There are 3 rounds and each round consists of different challenges. Each round starts with user and opponent life as 30. The longer the words you enter adhering to the conditions imposed, greater will be the reduction in opponent's life. To pass a round, the player must defeat the opponent. 

  The word searching is based on heuristic value assigned to each of the words in our dictionary. We have used heuristic based search with random assignment to ensure fair play against the user. Also, the opponent(AI) tries to maximize it's possibility to succeed at each pass.

  3 lifelines are provided over all 3 rounds. and each time the player disobeys the rules, lifeline will be deducted. If lifeline becomes 0, then the player loses.
